# Bike-Sharing-Assignment
Modelled bike sharing demand to assist management with resource allocation.

The project aims to model the demand for shared bikes using available independent variables. This modelling will provide insights for management on how demand varies with different features, enabling them to adjust business strategies accordingly to meet customer expectations. Additionally, the model will serve as a valuable tool for understanding demand dynamics in new markets, allowing for informed decision-making and effective allocation of resources.
